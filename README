h2. osxsh

handful of bash etc scripts for os x that I use for work.  
And a way to try out github.
  


*  killssh.sh : kills all background ssh processes (e.g. tunnels)
*  mount_remote_smb.sh tunnel_host server_host share [user] [lo alias]
  creates an ssh tunnel for 445 and mounts the server\share locally
